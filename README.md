## INTRO TO CLOUD

POC -> DEV_TEAM -> TEST_TEAM

TEST_TEAM -> DEV_TEAM -> CLOUD

**What is POC**

A Proof of Concept (POC) is a small, experimental implementation created to demonstrate that an idea, project, or technology is feasible and can work in practice. It‚Äôs often an early step before full development or deployment.



## WHAT IS CLOUD COMPUTING

Cloud Computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet (‚Äúthe cloud‚Äù), instead of using a local computer or on-premise server.

**These services include:**

Servers (virtual machines),

Storage (files, databases, backups),

Networking (load balancers, firewalls, VPNs),

Software (apps and development tools),

Analytics & AI services.
# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

**SDLC** stands for **Software Development Life Cycle**.  
It is a **step-by-step process** used by software developers and organizations to **plan, design, build, test, and deploy high-quality software**.

## üìò SDLC Phases

| **Phase**       | **Purpose**                                                    | **Main Deliverables**                            |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Requirements** | Collect and define what the user wants.                       | SRS (Software Requirement Specification)         |
| **2. Analysis**     | Study the feasibility, risks, and resources needed.           | Feasibility Report, Project Plan                 |
| **3. Design**       | Plan how the software will work (architecture, UI, database). | HLD (High-Level Design), LLD (Low-Level Design)  |
| **4. Development**  | Write the actual code and integrate modules.                  | Source Code, Unit Tests                          |
| **5. Testing**      | Verify that the software works correctly and is bug-free.     | Test Reports, Bug Logs                           |
| **6. Deployment**   | Deliver and install the software for end users.               | Release Notes, Deployment Logs                   |
| **7. Maintenance**  | Update, fix bugs, and improve performance after release.      | Patches, Updated Versions                        |

# SDLC Models

## 1. Waterfall Model

**Definition:**  
The Waterfall Model is a **sequential SDLC approach** where each phase must be completed before moving to the next:  
**Requirements ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Development ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Deployment ‚Üí Maintenance**.  
It‚Äôs like a ‚Äústep-by-step flow‚Äù of water ‚Äî once a phase is done, you **can‚Äôt go back**.

**Advantages:**  
- ‚úÖ Simple and easy to understand.  
- ‚úÖ Clearly defined stages and deliverables.  
- ‚úÖ Good for projects with well-defined, stable requirements.  
- ‚úÖ Easier to manage due to its structured approach.  

**Disadvantages:**  
- ‚ùå No flexibility ‚Äî difficult to go back and change anything.  
- ‚ùå Testing happens late (after development).  
- ‚ùå Not suitable for complex or evolving projects.  
- ‚ùå High risk and cost if requirements change mid-way.

## 2. Agile Model

**Definition:**  
Agile is an **iterative and incremental SDLC model** focusing on **customer collaboration, flexibility, and continuous delivery**.  
Work is divided into **sprints** (short cycles, typically 1‚Äì4 weeks).

**Advantages:**  
- ‚úÖ Highly flexible and adaptive to changes.  
- ‚úÖ Continuous feedback from stakeholders.  
- ‚úÖ Early and frequent delivery of working software.  
- ‚úÖ Encourages teamwork, communication, and collaboration.  
- ‚úÖ Improves product quality through regular testing.  

**Disadvantages:**  
- ‚ùå Requires experienced and self-organized teams.  
- ‚ùå Documentation can be minimal or inconsistent.  
- ‚ùå Scope creep (frequent changes can cause confusion).  
- ‚ùå Difficult for large, distributed teams without coordination.

## 3. DevOps Model

**Definition:**  
DevOps combines **Development (Dev)** and **Operations (Ops)** to ensure **continuous integration, testing, delivery, and monitoring**.  
Its goal is to **automate and shorten the software delivery cycle** using tools like **Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, Git, Ansible**, etc.

**Advantages:**  
- ‚úÖ Faster software delivery through automation (CI/CD).  
- ‚úÖ Better collaboration between developers and operations teams.  
- ‚úÖ Continuous monitoring and feedback improve reliability.  
- ‚úÖ Reduced time to market and higher customer satisfaction.  
- ‚úÖ Easier to detect and fix issues early.  

# DevOps Stages 

| **Stage**                 | **Description**                                             | **Activities**                                                                 | **Common Tools**                                  |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Planning**            | Define requirements, goals, and features                  | Sprint planning, backlog creation, user stories, resource allocation         | Jira, Trello, Azure Boards, Confluence          |
| **2. Coding / Development**| Write application code based on requirements             | Code implementation, version control, code review                             | Git, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket                  |
| **3. Continuous Integration (CI)** | Merge code frequently and automatically build/test     | Automated builds, unit testing, static code analysis                          | Jenkins, Travis CI, CircleCI, GitLab CI/CD      |
| **4. Continuous Testing**  | Automatically test the application for quality           | Unit testing, integration testing, functional testing, security testing       | Selenium, JUnit, TestNG, SonarQube, Postman    |
| **5. Continuous Deployment / Delivery (CD)** | Automatically deploy to staging/production        | Deployment automation, environment configuration, rollback planning           | Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, Puppet, Chef      |
| **6. Continuous Monitoring** | Monitor application performance and infrastructure     | Error logging, performance monitoring, security monitoring, incident response | Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, Nagios, Splunk |
| **7. Continuous Feedback** | Collect insights from users and stakeholders             | User analytics, bug reports, performance metrics, monitoring insights         | Jira, Bugzilla, Google Analytics, Feedback portals |
