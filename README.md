## INTRO TO CLOUD

POC -> DEV_TEAM -> TEST_TEAM

TEST_TEAM -> DEV_TEAM -> CLOUD

**What is POC**

A Proof of Concept (POC) is a small, experimental implementation created to demonstrate that an idea, project, or technology is feasible and can work in practice. It’s often an early step before full development or deployment.



## WHAT IS CLOUD COMPUTING

Cloud Computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet (“the cloud”), instead of using a local computer or on-premise server.

**These services include:**

Servers (virtual machines)

Storage (files, databases, backups)

Networking (load balancers, firewalls, VPNs)

Software (apps and development tools)

Analytics & AI services
